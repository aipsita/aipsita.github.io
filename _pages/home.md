### About me

I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the School of Mechanical Engineering at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/). As part of the [Convergence Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/), I am supervised by [Prof. Karthik Ramani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ramani/wordpress/featured-content/about/). I received my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/) in 2020. I received my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [NIT, Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/). My research focuses on the convergence of human factors, human-machine interaction design within the realm of engineering education, and industrial psychology. I see new breakthroughs in computing technology, including Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, as promising avenues to enhance human capabilities and expertise while enriching their daily lives.
